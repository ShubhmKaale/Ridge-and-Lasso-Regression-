# Ridge-and-Lasso-Regression

In this project i have first used Linear regression  and then used lasso and ridge regression to solve overfitting problem.  

what is overfitting?
-For training dataset model gives good/accurate results. Low bias result.
-For test dataset model gives bad results. High error.
-Low bias , high varience.

what is underfitting?
-For training dataset model gives bad results.
-For test dataset model gives bad results. High error.
-High bias, high varience.


Our main aim is that our Accuracy for train data and test data should be high. I.e low bias and low variance.
In this file i have implemented Ridge and lasso regression on boston data to find out which of them gives me low bias and low varience result.
